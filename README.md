FarmerCibil
Empowering farmers with integrated financial, marketplace, and sustainability tools powered by carbon markets.

FarmerCibil is a unified platform that combines marketplace access, loan eligibility, discounts, sustainability scoring, and yield tracking into a single ecosystem for farmers. By leveraging carbon markets, it enables farmers to monetize sustainable practices while accessing essential financial and market services.

🌱 Project Evolution & Integration
FarmerCibil merges three core components into one powerful platform:

Component	Purpose	Status
FarmerCibil Core	Loan scoring, marketplace access, discounts via carbon credits
BotanicaX	Sustainability scoring, data collection, yield prediction (The two projects work independently but the vision was same hence it is referenced inside this repo)
Carbon Markets	Monetizing sustainable farming practice
